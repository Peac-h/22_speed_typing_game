# Speed Typing Game

This is a typing game that displays a quote from a popular TV show and challenges the user to type the quote as quickly and accurately as possible. The game has different quotes from popular TV shows: Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Breaking Bad, Lucifer. The game keeps track of the user's time and accuracy, and displays the highest scores achieved so far. Only if each character of the quote is typed correctly the user is proceeded to the next round.

The design is responsive to all screen sizes.

**This is my API based project and the 22nd project so far.**

## Checkout The Live Demo

[Speeeeed Me]()

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript (using asynchronous js, public APIs, AJAX calls, modules and parcel bundler)

## JavaScript Features

The game was built using modern JavaScript features and the fetch API for making HTTP requests. For handling asynchronous behavior `Promise` object and `then()` `catch()` methods were used. Code contains a timer implementation, intervals to update the timer and logic to track the high score.

## How to Play

1. First, open the live demo to start playing the game.
2. The game will start automatically once the demo is open.
3. You will be presented with a quote on the screen. Your task is to type it as quickly and accurately as possible.
4. In order to progress to the next round, you must type each character of the quote correctly.
5. If you complete the quote without any errors, the game will generate a new quote and save your score.
6. Your best result will be displayed at the end of each round, so try to beat your previous score!
7. Don't cheat! You will not be able to copy and paste the quote anyways üòÅ
8. Have fun playing the game!
